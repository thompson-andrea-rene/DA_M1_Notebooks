        "You already know the `for` loop. There is a second loop, the `while` loop. The `while` loop offers more options, but is\n",

        "there are also situations where no sequence is available and yet a certain operation needs to be repeated multiple times:\n",
        "- At the ATM a PIN has to be entered (again and again) until it is entered correctly\n",
        "- A number should be entered until it is actually a number and the input string can be converted to an integer\n",

        "## Semantics of the `while` loop\n",
        "\n",
        "When the program reaches the loop, the condition behind the `while` keyword is checked. If this condition is `True`, the\n",
        "loop body is executed. At the end of the loop body, the program jumps back to the `while` and checks the condition\n",
        "again.  \n",
        "The loop is executed until the condition is `False`. After that, the program will continue after the\n",
